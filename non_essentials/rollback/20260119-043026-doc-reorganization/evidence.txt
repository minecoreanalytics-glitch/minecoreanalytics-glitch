# Evidence - Documentation Reorganization
# Date: 2026-01-19T04:30:26Z

## Initial State Assessment

### Directory Structure Check
Command: list_files(".", recursive=false)
Result: Confirmed ./docs/ folder exists but ./doc/ does not exist

### Existing Documentation Files Confirmed
1. PRD_MORPHEUS_PLATFORM.md (720 lines) - Contains complete PRD with:
   - Executive summary, product overview, features, technical requirements
   - User stories, success metrics, timeline
   
2. PHASE_0_ARCHITECTURE.md (62 lines) - Contains:
   - Core components architecture
   - Data source abstraction layer
   - Metadata catalog layer
   - Semantic layer
   
3. MVP_ROADMAP.md (116 lines) - Contains:
   - MVP definition
   - Current status (Phase 0: ~90% complete)
   - Roadmap phases
   - Timeline and success criteria

4. README.md (20 lines) - Contains:
   - Basic project setup instructions
   - Reference to AI Studio

5. docs/platform_catalog_plan.md (133 lines) - Contains:
   - Phase 0 catalog implementation plan
   - Component layout and OpenMetadata adapter details

### Git Status Check
Command: git status
Result: Exit code 128 - "fatal: not a git repository"
Decision: Use ./rollback/<timestamp>/ strategy as per SOP

### Documentation Structure Gap Analysis
Missing:
- ./doc/ folder (non-existent)
- ./laststep.md (non-existent)
- ./doc/README.md (not in standard location)
- ./doc/requirements.md (not present)
- ./doc/decisions.md (not present)
- ./doc/changelog.md (not present)
- ./doc/rollback-policy.md (not present)

Present but non-standard:
- ./docs/ folder (should be ./doc/)
- Root-level documentation files (should be in ./doc/)

## Justification for Changes
Per Code Mode SOP requirements:
1. All documentation must be in ./doc/ folder
2. laststep.md must exist for change tracking
3. Required doc stubs must exist before any code changes
4. Rollback capability must be established

## Expected Outcome
After changes:
- ./doc/ folder created with standardized structure
- Key documentation migrated from root to ./doc/
- Required stubs created
- laststep.md established for future tracking
- Root README.md updated to reference ./doc/
- Old ./docs/ folder content migrated to ./doc/
